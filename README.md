# Yo everyone


The frontend is now set to auto deploy on the links: 
- https://s3-fe-main.michalvalko.eu/ #main
- https://s3-fe-int.michalvalko.eu/  #integrate
- https://s3-fe-dev.michalvalko.eu/  #develop


link https://app-nes-frontend-main.cloud.sdu.dk/



The goal was to have 3 instances: main, integrate and develop. So far only the main works, but I will extend it soon enough. 
Backend and the database are not yet implemented in the pipelines. 

Good luck :)
