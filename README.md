# Yo everyone

The frontend is now set to auto deploy on this link https://app-nes-frontend-main.cloud.sdu.dk/

The goal was to have 3 instances: main, integrate and develop. So far only the main works, but I will extend it soon enough. 
Backend and the database are not yet implemented in the pipelines. 

Good luck :)
